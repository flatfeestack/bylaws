Everyone who is eligible for a membership can make a request(\emph{requestMembership}).

A new member has to be whitelisted by at least two DAA Chairmen before joining(\emph{whitelistMember}).
After the whitelisting and the payment of the membership fee (\emph{payMembershipFee}), the applicant becomes a DAA member and gains voting power for the next ballot vote.

\item \textbf{Awareness of Technological \& Conceptual Risks} \\
Blockchain is a new technology.
The technical or conceptual structure of this DAA and the DAA voting process may have weaknesses, as it is the case with every blockchain project.
Moreover, the DAA is dependent on the underlying Ethereum protocol.
Therefore, it may be possible that the DAA loses part or the whole of its funds or become incapable of acting.
Every member explicitly declares to be aware of and to agree to those risks.
